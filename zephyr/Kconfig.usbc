	  Enable this to support various USB Type-C features chosen by the
	  options below. USB-C is widely used on modern Chromebooks and the EC's
	  role is to negotiate power contracts (for sourcing or sinking power
	  over USB). The EC is also responsible for discovering the capabilities
	  of attached USB-C partners and enabling alternate operational modes,
	  including Display Port, Thunderbolt, and USB4.

	help
	  Each platform (e.g. baseboard set) should have a single VID/PID

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_BCD_DEV

	help
	  This specifies the USB device version, reported by board when acting

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_VID
	hex "USB Vendor ID"
	default 0x18d1

	  This specifies the USB vendor ID used for boards which expose a

	  Allows entry to a low power mode when the USB port is idle.
	  When enabled, an enter_low_power_mode member is present in tcpm_drv

	  Some TCPCs need additional time following a VBUS change to internally

	  Source USB Type-C connector voltage (VCONN) from the Type-C Port

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_CLEAR_HARD_RESET_STATUS
	bool "Clear PD hard reset status when PD setup completes"
	default y if SOC_SERIES_IT8XXX2
	help
	  Enabling this config will clear the Hard Reset event status
	  after the PD connection is finished initialization,
	  to avoid the AP getting a stale event notification.

	  The detection of a PD Hard Reset sets an status flag that
	  is then read by the AP in order to reset the USB muxes.
	  However by the time this is read, the connection may
	  have been re-initialized and is ready, but the AP may
	  process the hard reset as if it were still current,
	  causing the USB port to be incorrectly disabled.
	  The hard reset of the PD connection can be triggered
	  when the EC is detected as being initially powered on
	  (as opposed to being reset), to force clearing the connection.

	  This config is set by default for the IT8XXX2 EC, which
	  cannot distinguish between a reset and power-on, so a power-on
	  is assumed, which leads to the PD hard reset when the EC
	  undergoes a reset (such as when entering recovery mode).

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_PPC_DUMP
	bool "Console command: ppc_dump"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USBC_PPC
	default y
	help
	  Allows dumping of the Power Path Controller (PPC) state, which is
	  basically a list of registers and their values. The actual dump
	  function is driver-specific (the reg_dump member of ppc_drv). By
	  reference to the datasheet for the part this can help you figure out
	  what is going on.

config PLATFORM_EC_USBC_PPC_LOGGING
	bool "Enable PPC Related logging"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USBC_PPC
	default y
	help
	  PPC drivers use two print functions for logging error messages
	  (ppc_prints and ppc_err_prints). Setting this config adds the
	  CPRINTS call to both of these function which will enable PPC
	  related logging but increase EC image size.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_PULLUP
	int "Default source Rp value"

	help
	  Default pull-up value on the USB-C ports when they are used as source.
