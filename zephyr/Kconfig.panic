	bool "Software panic"
	default y
	help
	  Sometimes the EC has bugs that are provoked by unexpected events.
	  This enables storing a panic log and halt the system for

	  For testing purposes it is useful to be able to generation exceptions
	  to check that the panic reporting is working correctly. The enables
	  the 'crash' command which supports generating various exceptions,
	  selected by its parameter:

	     assert              - assertion failure (ASSERT() macro)
	     divzero             - division by zero
	     udivzero            - division of unsigned value by zero
	     stack (if enabled)  - stack overflow
	     unaligned           - unaligned access (e.g. word load from 0x123)
	     watchdog            - watchdog timer fired
	     hang                - infinite loop in the EC code

	help
	  When enabled, a copy of the console log is kept in
	  preserved uninitialized ram. The log can be dumped
	  after a panic for debugging.

	int "Size of EC panic log in bytes"
	default 2048
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_PANIC_LOG
