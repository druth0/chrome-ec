	  Driver for EGIS630 fingerprint sensor. It requires EGIS private library
	  to implement cros_fingerprint API. If the library is not available it
	  only supports checking sensor hardware ID.

	  Size of heap to be used by EGIS private library. The heap must have
	  enough size to keep finger templates during matching.
