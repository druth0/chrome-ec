  GPIO interrupts list bindings.

  Uses device tree to configure the interrupt handling e.g

    int_lid_open: lid_open {
      irq-pin = <&gpio_lid_open>;
      flags = <GPIO_INT_EDGE_BOTH>;
      handler = "lid_interrupt";
    };

  The interrupt can be enabled either using the DTS label:

    gpio_enable_dt_interrupt(GPIO_INT_FROM_NODELABEL(int_lid_open));

  or the legacy:

    gpio_enable_interrupt(GPIO_LID_OPEN);

compatible: "cros-ec,gpio-interrupts"

  properties:
    #
    # This is named irq-pin rather than irq-gpio because
    # anything with a name appended with "gpio" is treated specially,
    # which causes warnings about missing #gpio-cells.
