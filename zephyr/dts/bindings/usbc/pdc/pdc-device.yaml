  no-fw-update:

      If set, do NOT consider this node to be an independent PD chip and
      instruct Depthcharge to NOT apply firmware updates to this device. For
      two-port PDC devices where each port has its own DT node, one of them
      should have this property set to avoid updating the same chip twice
      through each port.
  ccd:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If present, this USB-C port has hardware support for closed-case
      debugging (CCD). Used only on boards with PDC-driven CCD. This should be
      applied to the port serviced by the PDC driver that correlates to PORTB
      on dual-port PDCs. On dual-port RTK PDCs, this is the lower I2C target
      address; on TI PDCs, this is the higher I2C address.
