  Common properties for temperature sensors that are not handled by drivers.
  Zero values in degrees K(-273 in degrees C)in thermal thresholds will
  be ignored

  description: Named temperature sensor node
  properties:
    sensor:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description:
        A pointer to a coresponding temperature sensor node.

    power-good-pin:
      type: phandle
      description:
        If this sensor will be unpowered some of the time, provide an input GPIO
        which can be referenced to detect whether the sensor is powered before
        reading.

    temp-fan-off:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature threshold in degrees C when no active cooling
        is needed

    temp-fan-max:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature threshold in degrees C when max active cooling
        is needed

    temp-host-warn:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature threshold in degrees C of thermal warn.
        Temperatures above the thermal warn threshold generate a
        request to the AP to throttle itself.

    temp-host-high:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature threshold in degrees C of thermal high.
        Temperatures above the thermal high threshold cause the EC to
        assert a signal (usually PROCHOT) to the AP and force the AP to
        throttle.

    temp-host-halt:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature threshold in degrees C that forces AP to shutdown
        due to thermal reason

    temp-host-release-warn:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature release threshold in degrees C of thermal warn

    temp-host-release-high:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature release threshold in degrees C of thermal high

    temp-host-release-halt:
      type: int
      description:
        Temperature release threshold in degrees C of thermal shutdown
